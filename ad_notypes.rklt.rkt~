; The below is an implementation of an Automatic Differentiation system
; without any type enforcements. The below has taken inspiration from
; https://crypto.stanford.edu/~blynn/haskell/ad.html


; We begin by defining a structure to store the function value and the
; value of the derivative itself.

(struct pair1 (fx fdx))

; fx denotes the value of the function at point x and
; fdx denotes the linear map that represents the derivative of f at x.


(define (exl (pair1 x y)
             x))

(define (exr (pair x y)
             y))
